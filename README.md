## ðŸ“Œ Task 02: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

**Track:** Machine Learning Internship â€” Prodigy InfoTech

### âœ… Task Objective

Create a **K-means clustering algorithm** to group retail store customers based on their purchase history and spending patterns.

### ðŸš€ What I Did

- Loaded and cleaned customer transaction data.
- Visualized data trends and distributions.
- Applied K-means clustering to segment customers.
- Analyzed clusters to understand customer behavior.

### ðŸ“š What I Learned

- Unsupervised learning with K-means.
- Data preprocessing for clustering.
- Evaluating clusters and choosing `k` using the Elbow Method.
- Visualizing clusters with scatter plots.

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- [Customer Segmentation Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- Download and place in a `data/` folder before running the notebook.
